1. Start with existing patterns: Use pubm-assistant as a template
2. Create state models: Define your conversation state schema
3. Build workflow graph: Use LangGraph for orchestration
4. Implementation storage: Choose Redis or ThreadStore pattern
5. Add tool integration: Follow intelligent idt tool patterns
6. Test incrementally

# Common patterns
1. Tiered pattern (used by Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPTs)

# State Graph Pattern
	State Graph pattern is not a standard GOF (Gang of Four) design pattern, but rather a classic State pattern used to model complex systems with state transitions and behaviors, often visualized or represented as a graph of states and transitions.
