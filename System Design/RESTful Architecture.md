REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural structure for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communication protocol -- the HTTP. REST is an architectural style, not a standard, and it defines a set of constraints and properties based on how components of a networked system should communicate.
